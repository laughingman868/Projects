This inspiration for this project started as a child after watching The Jackal, a movie featuring Bruce Willis and based on a book titled The Day of the Jackal. A lack of knowledge, time and spare funds resulted in putting it off for many years. 
There are four main components of this system, the weapon itself, a sighting system, the assembly to control the trigger, and the pan/tilt. After spending some time thinking about a way to mount the weapon, some research turned up a unit that looked very similar to what I had in mind. The weapon was mounted via the picatinny rail, so I took a similar approach.
