The goal of this project is to create a thermal image set containing common small arms such as rifles nd hand guns, create bounding boxes, then train an object detection model. I will use an Nvision Nox 18 for the footage, which is a thermal monocular/weapon sight, that uses a 640x480 resolution 12 pixel pitch BAE core. This is a semi-long running project, as it will take time to travel to various locations to capture the data, then annotate each image and create a JSON file. Images will be captured in batches as time permits, in wooded areas, desert locations and inside homes. The annotation format will be COCO.
