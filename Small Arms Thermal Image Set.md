The goal of this project is to create a thermal image set containing common small arms such as rifles nd hand guns, create bounding boxes, then train an object detection model. I will use an Nvision Nox 18 for the footage, which is a thermal monocular/weapon sight, that uses a 640x480 resolution 12 pixel pitch BAE core.
